### Favorite quote

> "All is well"  
> \- Three Idiots

This is my Family's favorite saying. My mom bought me a sign with the quote when I went to college because I was afraid of leaving home and my cat.

### Favorite code to use in the command shell
This command modifies a mp4 file by speeding it up by 4 times, removing sound, and compressing the file. I often use it to reduce my gaming recordings so they erase my mic sounds and speed up the video for the file to be small enough to upload to discord.

```
ffmpeg -i vid.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=PTS/4" -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -an finished.mp4
```

### My cat
![Ben](Imgs/ben.png)
This is Ben, my orange tabby cat. We got him from china so he's actually been in 3 countries and 15 states. He knows how to sit, shake, and dab. If you got to my github profile, you can see that he's in my pfp.

### My child
